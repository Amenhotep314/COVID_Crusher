# COVID Crusher
This repository is a full mirror of the development environment I used in the post-AP high school course *Advanced Topics in Computer Science: Virtual Reality*.
This is my first work with the Unity game engine. All scripts are written in C#, and I set out to model my own (rudimentary) assets and compose my own music.

## Gameplay
In COVID Crusher, the player takes on the roll of an immune system cell armed with whimsical lasers. Their goal is to shoot and destroy hostile COVID-19 viruses in the bloodstream without harming benign entities like red blood cells.
The player is aided by vaccine powerups that reduce the number of viruses they must fight. As gameplay continues, the infection becomes increasingly resistant, and the player must destroy more numerous, fast-moving opponents.

## Setup
This software is designed for use with Meta Quest headsets with hand controls. Development and play require an installation of Unity. While success was achieved in running the software live on a PC, technical issues persist in the headset binary.
